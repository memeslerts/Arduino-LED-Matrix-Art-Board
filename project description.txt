CREATIVE PROJECT:

A sketch pad in processing that allows you to draw pixel art and the corresponding drawing
will appear on an WS2182B LED 16x16 LED matrix. Each grid in the processing sketch pad
is mapped to an LED on the matrix, which when click signals the matrix to also activate
the corresponding LED.
